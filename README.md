# capgemini

In order to run the following project you will have to set up a NodeJS server locally as follows:

	1.	Download and Install nodejs ( https://nodejs.org/en/ )
	2.	Open TERMINAL and run npm install -g http-server
	3.	Go into the "capgemini" (where the index.html is) folder run http-server
	4.	visit: http://localhost:8080


The following exercise will be used to assess your ability to write good code. Specifically we want to assess your ability to write good semantic markup which is accessible. Bonus points will be awarded for mobile accessible solutions and those which can be rendered (to some degree) in a wide variety of browsers.

Exercise:
Please recreate the following page; get as far as you can in 30 to 40 minutes. We are not looking for pixel perfect solutions; we are mostly looking at how you structure your solution. If you cannot finish, make sure that you demonstrate a few examples of each skill described above.

You can add a brief README noting any changes you would have made if you had more time.

Although HMRC is increasingly using frameworks such as AngularJS, we would like you to do this exercise using basic HTML5, CSS and Javascript. You may use bits of jQuery if necessary but as a rule all of our content must be available to users without javascript enabled. Please donâ€™t use frameworks like Bootstrap.


# changes that I would've made

I would've:
- create a style guide stylesheet with helper and reusable classes;
- used Webpack;
- used SASS as a CSS preprocessor;
